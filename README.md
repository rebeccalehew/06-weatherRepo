# Weather Dashboard


## Deployed URL:



## Description

This weather dashboard used the OpenWeather API to show the forecast based on the parameters the user enter. The weather dashboard will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The weather dashboard will allows the user to search for a city, view the curent weather conditions, and view a 5-day forecast of that city. The extended forecast displays the date, and icon representation of the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Pertinent data is saved to local storage. 


## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

## Future Development:

This app is lacking in much of the functionality mentioned in the acceptance criteria. Time was a major obstacle in completing this project. With more time, I would like to add the JavaScript functionality. For future development, pulling in more relevant weather data (i.e. road risk or weather alerts) would be of great use to the user.
